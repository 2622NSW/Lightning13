## Sunshine Coast Lightning Round 13 2018

The University of the Sunshine Coast is hosted the [14th Australasian Conference on Mathematics and Computers in Sport](https://www.anziam.org.au/The+14th+Australasian+Conference+on+Mathematics+and+Computers+in+Sport).

On Saturday 28 July, some delegates attended the Super Netball Round 13 match between [the Sunshine Coast and the NSW Swifts at USC Stadium](https://www.usc.edu.au/explore/usc-news-exchange/news-archive/2018/july/maths-is-a-gamechanger-for-elite-sport).

Anthony Bedford said of this opportunity: 

> The performance analysis process, including the half-time and post-match analysis, will be broadcast live to delegates allowing them to contribute and gain an insight into the practical aspects of match-day.

I have been monitoring the 2018 Super Netball Season and shared my data as a contribution to an exciting opportunity for conference delegates to be involved in real-time decision support.

I shared three small .csv files.

- [**2018Season.csv**](https://github.com/2622NSW/Lightning13/blob/master/2018Season.csv) has all the results from the season with the exception of two drawn games.

- [**Lightning12.csv**](https://github.com/2622NSW/Lightning13/blob/master/Lightning12.csv) has scores per quarter for the Lightning's 12 games played in 2018.

- [**Swifts12.csv**](https://github.com/2622NSW/Lightning13/blob/master/Swifts12.csv) has scores per quarter for the Swifts' 12 games played in 2018.

## Some Additional Information

I had some basic priors to add to the anticipation of the outcome of the game between the Lightning and Swifts.

After 12 Rounds of the [2018 Season](https://supernetball.com.au/), the naive probabilities of teams winning (regardless of venue and opponent) are:

- 0.63 if winning at the end of the first quarter

- 0.76 if winning at the end of the second quarter

- 0.87 if winning at the end of the third quarter

Six of the 46 games with a winning outcome have been won by a team losing until the final quarter.

Median Profiles

The Lightning's median goal scoring profile this season by quarter is: 15, 15, 16, 13.

The lightning's median goal conceding profile this season by quarter is: 15, 14, 13, 13.

The Swifts' median goal scoring profile this season by quarter is: 14, 14, 14, 14.

The Swifts' median goal conceding profile this season by quarter is: 15, 15, 15, 14.

The two teams met in [Round 7](https://mc.championdata.com/super_netball/index.html?competitionid=10393&matchid=103930704) this season. The scores per quarter were:

- Swifts: 19, 12, 14, 14.

- Lightning: 9, 18, 16, 13.

This was the only quarter in this season's Lighning's games in which the team scored single digit goals in a quarter.

My naive priors for the Round 13 game, with regard to when goals will be scored by quarter are:

- Lightning: 0.27, 0.25, 0.27, 0.22

- Swifts: 0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25

The Swifts' first quarter goals remained their best first quarter in 2018 until Round 11 when they scored 20.

My anticipated score: a Lightning win 60 v 54.
