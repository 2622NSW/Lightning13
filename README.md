##Sunshine Coast Lightning Round 13 2018

The University of the Sunshine Coast is hosting the 14th Australasian Conference on Mathematics and Computers in Sport (https://www.anziam.org.au/The+14th+Australasian+Conference+on+Mathematics+and+Computers+in+Sport)

On Saturday 28 July, delegates will have the opportunity to watch the Super Netball Round 13 match between the Sunshine Coast and the NSW Swifts at USC Stadium (https://www.usc.edu.au/explore/usc-news-exchange/news-archive/2018/july/maths-is-a-gamechanger-for-elite-sport).

Anthony Bedford reports “The performance analysis process, including the half-time and post-match analysis, will be broadcast live to delegates allowing them to contribute and gain an insight into the practical aspects of match-day”.

I have been monitoring the 2018 Super Netball Season and am sharing my data as a contribution to what sounds like an exciting opportunity for conference delegates to be involved in real-time decision support.

I have three small .csv files to share.

2018Season.csv has all the results from the season with the exception of two drawn games.

Lightning12.csv has scores per quarter for the Lightning's 12 games played in 2018.

Swifts12.csv has scores per quarter for the Swifts' 12 games played in 2018.
