Some Additional Information

I have some basic priors to add to the anticipation of the outcome of the game between the Lightning and Swifts.

After 12 Rounds of the 2018 Season, the naive probabilities of teams winning (regardless of venue and opponent) are:

0.63 if winning at the end of the first quarter

0.76 if winning at the end of the second quarter

0.87 if winning at the end of the third quarter

Six of the 46 games with a winning outcome have been won by a team losing until the final quarter.

Median Profiles

The Lightning's median goal scoring profile this season by quarter is: 15, 15, 16, 13.

The lightning's median goal conceding profile this season by quarter is: 15, 14, 13, 13.

The Swifts' median goal scoring profile this season by quarter is: 14, 14, 14, 14.

The Swifts' median goal conceding profile this season by quarter is: 15, 15, 15, 14.

The two teams met in Round 7 this season. The scores per quarter were:

Swifts: 19, 12, 14, 14.

Lightning: 9, 18, 16, 13.

This was the only quarter in this season's Lighning's games in which the team score single digit goals in a quarter.

The Swifts' first quarter goals remained their best first quarter in 2018 until Round 11 when they scored 20.
